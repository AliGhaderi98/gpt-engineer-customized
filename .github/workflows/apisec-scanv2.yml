# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.

# documentation.

# APIsec addresses the critical need to secure APIs before they reach production.
# APIsec provides the industryâ€™s only automated and continuous API testing platform that uncovers security vulnerabilities and logic flaws in APIs.
# Clients rely on APIsec to evaluate every update and release, ensuring that no APIs go to production with vulnerabilities.


# The link to view the scan results is also displayed on the console on successful completion of action.

# This is a starter workflow to help you get started with APIsec-Scan Actions
